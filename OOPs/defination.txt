1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.

2. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class).

3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, typically through method overriding.

4. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

Summary
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods, restricting access (C++: private members, JS: underscore convention).
Inheritance: New class inherits properties from an existing class (C++: public inheritance, JS: extends).
Polymorphism: Methods doing different things based on the object (C++: virtual functions, JS: method overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding complex details, showing only necessary parts (C++: pure virtual functions, JS: method throwing error).
